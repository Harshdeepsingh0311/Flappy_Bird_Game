# Flappy Bird Game In Python (Using Pygame Module)

This Flappy Bird Game is created by Harshdeep Singh in a python module named as pygame. This is practice game development in python project done by me to get familiar with some game development stuffs in python.

## Basic Logic 

The Basic Logic behind this game is There are some poles which are moving from right to left and soon as they collide with left edge of the screen they gets appeared on the right end and start moving again. 

By pressing the space bar the bird's y coordinate gets increased which in pygame means gets decreased so that the bird seems to be flying and raising upwards. Also checking the collison is also achieved through creating a isCollide function which checks all the collissions like with pipe, ground and sky. Before game starts there is also a main menu type screen which gets vanished by pressing space bar and the game starts  

**Feel free to ask any query related to anything and use the code for the same, you can improve this game by raising issues and solving it. These two concepts are neccesary to create this game like i did, There can be many approaches to achieve this but i sought out this so i made this game like this only. Looking towards for your cooperation.....**
